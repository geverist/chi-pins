## Advanced Demo Tips

### For Technical Investors
- Show admin panel (PIN: check with team)
- Demonstrate game customization
- Show analytics dashboard
- Highlight API integration capabilities

### For Industry-Specific VCs
- **Healthcare VCs**: Focus on HCAHPS improvement and patient engagement
- **Retail VCs**: Emphasize dwell time increase and omnichannel integration
- **Hospitality VCs**: Highlight ancillary revenue and guest satisfaction
- **Fintech VCs**: Showcase transaction fees and payment integration

### Handling Objections

**"What about competition from Square/Toast/existing POS?"**
> *"We partner with them, not compete. Our platform integrates with Square, Toast, and Clover. We're the engagement layer, they're the transaction layer. In fact, 60% of our pipeline comes through POS reseller partnerships."*

**"How do you prevent content from getting stale?"**
> *"Three ways: 1) Quarterly content updates included in subscription, 2) AI-powered game generation (GPT-4 integration creates custom trivia), 3) Community-sourced content with moderation system."*

**"Isn't this just killing time? Where's the real value?"**
> *"Time is money. For restaurants, reducing perceived wait time by 35% means 18% fewer walkouts during peak hours. For auto dealerships, engaged customers spend $1,200 more on parts. For hotels, entertained guests book $45 more in ancillary services. This isn't killing time—it's monetizing attention."*

**"Can you scale without massive sales team?"**
> *"Channel partnerships. 40% of sales come through POS resellers (Toast, Square, Clover) who bring customers at $400 CAC instead of $1,600. We also have white-label licensing where industry-specific resellers rebrand our platform. One deal with a medical equipment distributor could reach 1,000 clinics overnight."*
