# Deployment Summary - Recent Updates

## 1. Anonymous Messaging Feature

- "💬 Message Anonymously" button shows on pins that opted in

### Setup required:
**You need to run the SQL migration before this will work!**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the entire `setup-anonymous-messaging.sql` file
3. This creates the necessary database columns and tables

See `ANONYMOUS_MESSAGING_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### How to test:
1. Create a new pin
2. On confirmation screen, check "Allow visitors to message me anonymously"
3. Select Email or Phone as contact method
4. Submit the pin
5. Click "Explore" and click on your pin
6. You should see a purple "💬 Message Anonymously" button

### Admin Settings:
