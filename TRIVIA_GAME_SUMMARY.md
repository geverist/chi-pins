### Scoring System

**Total Score = (Base Score + Speed Bonus) × Accuracy Multiplier**

**Components:**

1. **Base Score**: 1,000 points per correct answer
   - 10/10 correct = 10,000 base points
   - 7/10 correct = 7,000 base points

2. **Speed Bonus**: Up to 3,000 points
   - Based on average time per question
   - Faster = more bonus
   - Formula: `((MaxTime - AvgTime) / MaxTime) × 3000`

3. **Accuracy Multiplier**: 1.0 to 2.0
   - 0% accuracy = 1.0× multiplier
   - 50% accuracy = 1.5× multiplier
   - 100% accuracy = 2.0× multiplier
   - Formula: `1 + (accuracy% / 100)`

**Example Scores:**

| Correct | Avg Time | Base  | Speed Bonus | Multiplier | Total Score |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 10/10   | 5s       | 10,000| 2,000       | 2.0×       | ~24,000     |
| 10/10   | 10s      | 10,000| 1,000       | 2.0×       | ~22,000     |
| 8/10    | 7s       | 8,000 | 1,600       | 1.8×       | ~17,280     |
