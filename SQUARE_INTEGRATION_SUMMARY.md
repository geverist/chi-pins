# Square POS Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete ordering system for Chicago Mike's integrated with Square POS, allowing customers to:
1. Browse the menu from Square Catalog
2. Add items to cart
3. Checkout with payment
4. Receive order confirmation
5. Orders automatically appear in Square POS for fulfillment

## Files Created

### Backend API Endpoints (Vercel Serverless Functions)
- `/api/square-menu.js` - Fetches menu items from Square Catalog API
- `/api/square-create-order.js` - Creates orders in Square
- `/api/square-create-payment.js` - Processes payments via Square Payments API

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/OrderMenu.jsx` - Main menu browsing interface with cart
- `src/components/CheckoutModal.jsx` - Payment form using Square Web Payments SDK
- `src/components/OrderConfirmation.jsx` - Success screen after order placement

### Hooks & State Management
- `src/hooks/useOrderCart.js` - Shopping cart state management

### UI Integration
- Added "üçï Order Now" button to footer in `src/App.jsx`
- Modal-based UI that overlays the map interface

### Configuration & Documentation
- Updated `.env.example` with Square environment variables
- `SQUARE_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `SQUARE_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed special character encoding issues (curly quotes, em dashes)
- Renamed `useKioskMode.js` to `.jsx` for proper JSX handling
- Added missing `exitFullscreenAndWake` function export

## User Flow

1. **Browse Menu**
   - Customer clicks "üçï Order Now" in footer
   - Menu loads from Square Catalog with categories
   - Items show with variations (sizes) and pricing

2. **Build Cart**
   - Click "+ Add" to add items
   - Cart summary shows at bottom with total

3. **Checkout**
   - Click "Checkout" button
   - Enter name and phone number
   - Enter payment card details (Square Web Payments SDK)
   - Click "Pay" to submit

4. **Confirmation**
   - Order created in Square
   - Payment processed
   - Success screen shows order number and total
   - Order appears in Square POS for fulfillment

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
- **Payment Processing**: Square Web Payments SDK
- **APIs**: Square Catalog API, Orders API, Payments API

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Server-side (secret)
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id

# Client-side (public)
VITE_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id
```

## Security Features

- Access token kept server-side only (not exposed to client)
- Payment card details handled by Square SDK (PCI compliant)
- Customer payment info never touches your server
- CORS enabled for API endpoints

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Square Account Setup**
   - Create Square Developer account
   - Create application and get credentials
   - Add menu items to Square Dashboard

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add Square credentials to Vercel environment variables
   - Use production credentials (not sandbox)

3. **Testing**
   - Test in sandbox mode first
   - Verify orders appear in Square Dashboard
   - Test payment processing

4. **Go Live**
   - Switch to production credentials
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Monitor orders in Square POS

## Features Not Yet Implemented

Optional enhancements for future development:

- **Order modifications** (modify quantity in cart with +/- buttons)
- **Special instructions** (add notes to items)
- **Order history** (show past orders for returning customers)
- **Loyalty integration** (connect loyalty phone to Square customer profiles)
- **Delivery/pickup time selection** (currently ASAP only)
- **Tip calculation** (add tip amount to payment)
- **Saved payment methods** (Square stored cards)
- **Order status tracking** (real-time updates from Square)
