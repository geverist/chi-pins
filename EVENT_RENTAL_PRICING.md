# Event-Based Sales: Rental Models & Pricing Strategy
**EngageOS™ Event Check-In & Entertainment Kiosks**

---

## RENTAL BUSINESS MODEL OVERVIEW

**Key Insight**: Events are 1-5 day occurrences, not 24/7 deployments. Rental model captures higher revenue per day than monthly subscriptions.

**Comparison**:
- Monthly SaaS: $799/month = $26.63/day
- Event Rental: $499-3,999 per event (1-3 days) = $166-1,333/day
- **Revenue multiplier**: 6-50x higher daily rate vs monthly subscription
