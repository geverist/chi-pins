## INITIATIVE 1: INSIGHTS DASHBOARD

### Timeline: 8 Weeks (Jan 2 - Feb 27, 2025)

#### Week 1-2: Requirements & Design
**Team**: 1 Product Manager, 1 Designer

**Deliverables**:
- User research (interview 10 existing customers)
- Feature spec document
- Wireframes for 5 core dashboards:
  1. Customer Journey Analytics
  2. Upsell Performance (conversion rates by game, time of day, customer segment)
  3. Competitive Benchmarking (compare your restaurant to anonymized peers)
  4. Sentiment Analysis (emotion detection from feedback + voice)
  5. Predictive Insights (AI-powered recommendations)
- Pricing model finalized (+$199/month add-on, 30% attach rate target)

**Key Decisions**:
- Which metrics matter most? (Survey customers: dwell time, conversion rate, NPS, revenue per visit)
- Real-time vs daily batch updates? (Real-time for large enterprise, daily for SMB)
- Mobile app or web-only? (Web-only for MVP, mobile in v2)

---

#### Week 3-5: Backend Development
**Team**: 2 Backend Engineers

**Technical Tasks**:
1. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Aggregate kiosk interaction data (game plays, upsell acceptances, feedback scores)
   - Build ETL pipeline (Extract from Supabase, Transform for analytics, Load into data warehouse)
   - Use **ClickHouse** or **BigQuery** for fast analytics queries
   - Implement caching layer (Redis) for real-time dashboards

2. **Predictive ML Models**:
   - Train upsell prediction model (LightGBM or XGBoost)
   - Features: time of day, day of week, game played, previous purchases, dwell time
   - Target: Predict probability customer accepts upsell (0-100%)
   - Accuracy target: 75%+ (vs 50% baseline)

3. **API Development**:
   - `/api/analytics/journey` - Customer flow through kiosk
   - `/api/analytics/upsells` - Conversion funnel breakdown
   - `/api/analytics/sentiment` - Emotion scores from feedback
   - `/api/analytics/benchmarks` - Industry comparison data (anonymized)
   - `/api/analytics/predictions` - AI recommendations

**Tech Stack**:
- Backend: Node.js (existing stack) + Python for ML
- Database: ClickHouse (columnar DB, 100x faster than Postgres for analytics)
- ML: scikit-learn, LightGBM
- Caching: Redis
- Job Queue: BullMQ (for batch processing)

---

#### Week 6-7: Frontend Development

   - Quick filters (date range, location, game type)

2. **Customer Journey Visualizer**:
   - Sankey diagram showing flow: Entry → Game → Upsell → Checkout
   - Drop-off rates at each stage
   - Click to drill down into specific paths

3. **Upsell Performance**:
   - Table: Game name, plays, upsell prompts shown, acceptances, conversion %
   - Sort by conversion % to find best/worst performers
   - Recommendations: "Try Chicago Dog game at lunchtime for 12% higher conversions"

4. **Competitive Benchmarking**:
   - Bar charts: Your restaurant vs industry average
   - Metrics: Dwell time, conversion rate, games per visit, social shares
   - Percentile ranking (You're in top 25% for upsell conversion!)

5. **Sentiment Heatmap**:
   - Calendar view showing daily sentiment scores (green = positive, red = negative)
   - Click date to see feedback comments
   - AI summary: "Customers love your trivia game but complain about long waits"

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: React (existing)

- 100 venues opted in
- 10M monthly impressions
- 0.5% CTR (50K clicks)
- $1.50 CPM effective rate

**Venue Owner Payouts**:
- $15K revenue × 70% = $10.5K total

**Agentiosk Earnings**:
- $15K × 30% = $4.5K/month ($54K annually from pilot alone)

**Optimization Loop**:
- A/B test ad creative (video vs static image)
- Test placement (loading screen vs post-game)

**Week 3-4: ID Verification Integration**
**Team**: 2 Backend Engineers

**Jumio Integration Workflow**:
```javascript
// 1. Guest places ID on scanner or uses selfie camera
const idImage = await captureIDImage();

// 2. Send to Jumio API for verification
const jumioResult = await fetch('https://api.jumio.com/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${JUMIO_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    image: idImage,
    selfie: selfieImage, // Optional biometric match
    country: 'USA', // Or auto-detect from ID
    documentType: 'DRIVERS_LICENSE' // or PASSPORT, ID_CARD
  })
});

// 3. Jumio returns verification results
const result = await jumioResult.json();
/*
{
  "verified": true,
  "documentAuthentic": true, // Real vs fake ID
  "biometricMatch": 0.96, // Selfie vs ID photo (0-1 scale)
  "extractedData": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "dateOfBirth": "1985-03-15",
    "address": "123 Main St, Chicago IL",
    "idNumber": "S123-4567-8901",
    "expirationDate": "2028-03-15",
    "photoUrl": "https://jumio.com/photos/abc123.jpg"
  },
  "riskScore": 12 // 0-100, lower = less risky
}
*/

// 4. If verified, print badge
if (result.verified && result.documentAuthentic && result.biometricMatch > 0.85) {
  await printBadge({
    name: `${result.extractedData.firstName} ${result.extractedData.lastName}`,
    company: attendeeData.company,
    photo: result.extractedData.photoUrl,
    qrCode: generateQRCode(attendeeData.id)
  });
} else {
  // Flag for manual review
  await flagForReview(attendeeData.id, result);
}
```

**Fraud Prevention**:
- Duplicate detection (prevent same ID used twice)
- Liveness detection (ensure real person, not photo of ID)
- Watchlist screening (check against banned attendee list)
- Real-time alerts to event staff for suspicious verifications

**Compliance**:
- GDPR: Auto-delete ID images after 30 days
- CCPA: Allow users to request data deletion
- Data encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit

async function printBadge(attendee) {
  const printer = new ZebraPrinter();
  await printer.connect(); // Auto-detect USB printer

  // ZPL (Zebra Programming Language) template
  const zplTemplate = `
    ^XA
    ^FO50,50^GB700,500,4^FS
    ^FO100,100^A0N,60,60^FD${attendee.name}^FS

const squareAuthUrl = `https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=${SQUARE_CLIENT_ID}&scope=MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ+ITEMS_READ+ORDERS_READ`;
window.location.href = squareAuthUrl;

// 3. Merchant approves permissions
// 4. Square redirects back with auth code
const authCode = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('code');

// 5. Exchange auth code for access token
const tokenResponse = await fetch('https://connect.squareup.com/oauth2/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    client_id: SQUARE_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: SQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    code: authCode,
    grant_type: 'authorization_code'
  })
});

const { access_token } = await tokenResponse.json();
// Store access_token in database for merchant
```

2. **Sync Menu Items** (show on kiosk):
```javascript
// Fetch menu from Square Catalog API
const catalogResponse = await fetch('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/catalog/list?types=ITEM', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${access_token}` }
});

const { objects } = await catalogResponse.json();
// objects = array of menu items with name, price, description, image

// Display in kiosk UI
objects.forEach(item => {
  // Show item in game upsell prompt
  // "Add a Chicago Dog for $${item.variations[0].price_money.amount / 100}?"
});
```

3. **Send Orders to Square** (upsell accepted):
```javascript
// Customer accepts upsell on kiosk
const order = await fetch('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/orders', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    order: {
      location_id: merchant.location_id,
      line_items: [{
        catalog_object_id: item.id,
        quantity: '1'
      }],
      metadata: {
        source: 'EngageOS_Kiosk_Upsell',
        game_played: 'Chicago_Dog_Assembly'
      }
    },
    idempotency_key: generateUUID() // Prevent duplicate orders
  })
});

// Order appears in Square POS, kitchen sees it
```

4. **Webhook Subscriptions** (real-time updates):
```javascript
// Subscribe to Square events
await fetch('https://connect.squareup.com/v2/webhooks/subscriptions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${access_token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    subscription: {
      name: 'EngageOS_Order_Updates',
      event_types: [
        'order.created',
        'order.updated',
        'catalog.version.updated'
      ],
      notification_url: 'https://api.agentiosk.com/webhooks/square'
    }
  })
});

// When Square menu changes, we get webhook and auto-sync
```
