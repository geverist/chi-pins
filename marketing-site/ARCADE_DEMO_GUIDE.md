## Advanced Tips

### Make it Interactive (Arcade's Superpower)
Instead of exporting as video, use **interactive embed**:

**Benefits**:
- Visitors control the speed (pause/play)
- Click hotspots to jump to specific features
- Analytics: See which features people explore
- Faster loading than video files

**How to Enable**:
- In Arcade editor, turn on **"Interactive Mode"**
- Add **clickable hotspots**: "Click to see Photo Booth"
- Create **branching paths**: "Try Game" vs "See Map"
- Export as embed code (not video)

### Add Lead Capture
- In Arcade editor, enable **"Lead Form"**
- Visitor must enter email to view demo
- Captures leads automatically
- Integrates with HubSpot/Salesforce

### Create Multiple Versions
**Short Version** (30 seconds):
- Quick overview for social media
- Just show main menu + one game
- Export as vertical video (9:16) for Instagram/TikTok

**Feature-Specific Demos**:
- "Photo Booth Feature" (30 sec)
- "Upsell System" (45 sec)
- "Games Library" (1 min)
- Use in sales emails for specific features

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Recording is laggy
**Fix**: Close all other tabs/apps before recording

### Issue: App is too small in video
**Fix**:
- Zoom browser to 125% (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus)
- Re-record
- Arcade captures zoomed view

### Issue: Text is blurry
**Fix**: Export at higher resolution (4K instead of 1080p)

### Issue: Audio/video out of sync
**Fix**:
- Record voiceover separately
- Add in post-production (Arcade editor)

### Issue: Demo is too long (>2 min)
**Fix**:
- Trim steps in Arcade editor
