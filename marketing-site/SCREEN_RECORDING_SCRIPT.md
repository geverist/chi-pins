## Pro Tips

### Voiceover Tips:
1. **Smile while talking** - it makes your voice sound friendly
2. **Vary your pace** - slow down for important features, speed up for transitions
3. **Emphasize numbers** - "2,461% ROI" should sound impressive!
4. **Use pauses** - let visual moments breathe (e.g., when upsell appears)

### Visual Tips:
1. **Hover before clicking** - give viewers 1 second to see what you're about to click
2. **Slow down dragging** - in the Chicago Dog game, drag slowly so viewers can see
3. **Let animations complete** - don't rush through particle effects or transitions
4. **Zoom in on text** - if showing small text, zoom browser to 125%

### Editing Tips (if using Descript/iMovie):
1. **Add text overlays**:
   - "40% Conversion Rate" when showing upsell
   - "2,461% ROI" in closing scene
   - "agentiosk.com" as end card
2. **Background music**: Subtle, upbeat (royalty-free from YouTube Audio Library)
3. **Transitions**: Simple fades (don't over-animate)
4. **Captions**: Auto-generate in Descript for accessibility
