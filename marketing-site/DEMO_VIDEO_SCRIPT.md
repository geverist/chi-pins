## Production Notes

### Screen Recording Workflow:
1. **Set up kiosk in demo mode** (Shift+D+M+O â†’ select "restaurant" vertical)
2. **Clear browser data** (so it looks fresh, no cached high scores)
3. **Record in 1920Ã—1080** (use OBS Studio or QuickTime)
4. **Slow down gameplay** (so viewers can see drag-and-drop actions clearly)
5. **Zoom in on key interactions** (tap animations, upsell prompts)

### Screens to Capture:

**Home Screen**:
- Show "Welcome to Chicago Mikes!" branding
- Highlight 4 buttons: Games, Photo Booth, Pin Map, Feedback

**Chicago Dog Assembly Game**:
- Show instructions screen
- Record full gameplay (drag each topping)
- Show success screen + upsell prompt
- Show "Add fries for $3.50?" â†’ click "Yes"

**Photo Booth**:
- Tap "Photo Booth"
- Show camera view with branded overlay ("Chicago Mikes | Since 1960")
- Take photo (smile!)
- Show "Share to Instagram" prompt
- Show preview with hashtag pre-filled (#ChicagoMikes)

**Analytics Dashboard** (mockup if needed):
- Create simple dashboard graphic in Figma/Canva
- Show metrics: Total interactions, average session time, upsell conversion
- Bar chart: Revenue by month (Month 1: $8K â†’ Month 6: $18K)

### Voiceover Tips:
- **Tone**: Enthusiastic but professional (like Explainer Video style)
- **Pacing**: 150 words/min (natural conversational speed)
- **Music**: Upbeat background music (royalty-free from Epidemic Sound or Artlist)
- **Sound effects**: Add subtle "ding" sound when upsell prompt appears
- **Captions**: Add subtitles for accessibility (auto-generate on YouTube)

### Editing Software:
- **Beginner**: iMovie (Mac), Clipchamp (Windows)
- **Intermediate**: DaVinci Resolve (free)
- **Advanced**: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro

### B-Roll Footage (if available):
- Real customers at Chicago Mikes using kiosk
- Exterior shot of Chicago Mikes storefront
- Close-up of hot dog being assembled
- Instagram posts on phone screen

### Alternative: No-Camera Version
If you don't want to film on-location:
