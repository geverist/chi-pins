**Target Segments**:
- Wedding venues & planners
- Corporate event venues
- Conference centers
- Party rental companies

**Primary Value Proposition**: Transform event downtime (cocktail hour, transitions, networking breaks) into engagement, data capture, and memorable experiences that generate social UGC and vendor referrals

**Unit Economics**:
- **Per-Event Rental Model**: $500-2,500 per event (1-3 day rental)
- **Venue Partnership Model**: $899/month + $150 per event usage fee
- **Event Planner White-Label**: $1,999/month (unlimited events, rebrand as their own service)
- Hardware Cost: $2,700 (kiosk) - venues purchase, event planners rent
- Gross Margin: 88% (rental model, no hardware COGS)
- LTV: $28,788 (estimated 24-month event planner partnership)

**Unique Vertical Advantage**:
- High emotion + social sharing = viral marketing goldmine
- Zero competition (no one does gamified event engagement kiosks)
- Recurring revenue from venues + planners (not one-time sales)

2. **Roaming Photographers**: $1,500-3,000 per event
   - Pros: Professional quality photos
   - Cons: Expensive, guests don't get instant sharing, no interaction during downtime

3. **Instagram Walls / Hashtag Displays**: $300-800 rental
   - Pros: Encourages social sharing
   - Cons: Passive (just displays posts), doesn't create content, no games

4. **Event Apps** (Eventbrite, Whova): $500-2,000 per event
   - Pros: Schedules, networking, surveys
   - Cons: Low adoption (30% of guests download), no physical presence

## Customer Pain Points & Solutions

### Pain Point #1: Awkward Downtime During Events
**Impact**: Guests bored during cocktail hour, dinner transitions, networking breaks → leave early, complain on social media

**EngageOS Solution**:

  - Questions: "Where did they meet?" "What's their dog's name?" "Honeymoon destination?"
  - Leaderboard: Top 3 guests get shout-out during speeches
  - Photo booth: Branded overlays with couple's names + wedding date

**Corporate Event Scenario**:
- **Networking Breaks**: "Company Trivia Challenge"
  - Questions about company history, products, values
  - Team-based: Departments compete (Sales vs Marketing vs Engineering)
  - Prizes: Winner gets free drinks, team lunch with CEO

**Conference Scenario**:
- **Between Sessions**: "Industry Trivia" and "Predict the Keynote" game
  - Questions about conference topics (tech trends, industry news)
  - Predictions: "What will the keynote speaker's #1 takeaway be?" → winner gets VIP dinner

**ROI**:
- Guest satisfaction scores increase 22% (post-event surveys)
- Social media mentions increase 3x (guests share game scores, photo booth pics)
- Event planner referrals increase 40% ("That kiosk was so fun!")

---

### Pain Point #2: Hard to Capture Guest Contact Info for Follow-Ups
**Impact**:
- Weddings: Can't send thank-you notes, anniversary reminders
- Corporate: Can't follow up with leads, measure engagement
- Conferences: Lose potential customers, can't nurture leads

**EngageOS Solution**:

**Data Capture via Games**:
- "Enter email to see your trivia score and compete for prizes"
- "Text me my photo booth pictures" (captures phone number)
- "Join our email list for event photos and updates"

**Corporate Lead Generation**:
- "Scan your badge to play" (integrates with event registration systems like Eventbrite, Cvent)
- CRM sync: Captured data flows to Salesforce, HubSpot
- Lead scoring: Track which games guests played, time spent at kiosk → behavioral insights

**ROI**:

**Weddings**:
```
140 guests × 60% engagement = 84 emails captured
Value: Wedding couple builds email list for future events (anniversary parties, baby showers)
Event planner value: Add 84 emails to their marketing list (future bookings)
```

**Corporate Events**:
```
200 attendees × 55% engagement = 110 leads captured
110 × 12% conversion to sales meeting × $15K avg deal = $198K pipeline value
Kiosk rental cost: $1,200
ROI: 16,400%
```

---

### Pain Point #3: Events Don't Go Viral (Low Social Sharing)
**Impact**:
- Weddings: Only 20-30% of guests post photos on Instagram
- Corporate: No brand awareness beyond attendees
- Conferences: Miss opportunity for free marketing

**EngageOS Solution**:

**Viral Mechanics**:

1. **Photo Booth with Custom Overlays**:
   - Weddings: Couple's names, wedding date, custom hashtag (#SmithWedding2025)
   - Corporate: Company logo, event branding, "We're hiring!" CTA
   - Conferences: Conference logo, sponsor logos (monetization opportunity)

2. **Instant Social Sharing**:
   - "Share your photo to Instagram/Facebook/Twitter"
   - Pre-filled caption with hashtag + event details
   - QR code for instant download to phone

3. **Gamified Achievements**:
   - "Most Popular Photo" contest (most likes on Instagram wins prize)
   - "Trivia Champion" badge (share your high score)
   - "I Attended [Event Name]" achievement unlock

**ROI**:

**Weddings**:
```
Before EngageOS: 140 guests × 25% post photos = 35 Instagram posts
After EngageOS: 140 guests × 68% share photo booth pics = 95 Instagram posts
95 posts × 400 avg followers = 38,000 impressions (free marketing for venue, planner, vendors)
Venue referral value: 38,000 impressions × 0.5% booking rate × $5,000 avg venue fee = $950 new revenue per wedding
```

**Corporate Events**:
```
200 attendees × 70% share branded photos = 140 Instagram posts
140 posts × 600 avg followers (professionals) = 84,000 impressions
Brand awareness value: $84,000 impressions × $15 CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions) = $1,260 equivalent ad spend
Actual kiosk cost: $1,200
Free marketing value: Equal to rental cost!
```

### Pain Point #4: Events Feel Generic (Lack Personalization)
**Impact**: Guests don't feel special, event feels like "just another wedding/party"

**EngageOS Solution**:

**Wedding Customization**:
- Custom trivia about couple's love story
  - "Where did [Groom] propose?" with multiple choice answers
  - "What's [Bride]'s favorite song?" → Play it on event speakers when someone gets it right
- Photo booth with couple's engagement photos as overlays
- Achievement: "Visited [Number] venues to find this one" (fun fact)

**Corporate Event Customization**:

- Trivia about company milestones ("What year was [Company] founded?")
- CEO messages: "Welcome from our CEO" video plays on kiosk
- Product showcase: "Match the product to its launch year" game

**Conference Customization**:
- Keynote speaker trivia ("Fun facts about [Speaker Name]")
- Sponsor showcase games (sponsors pay for branded games)
- Agenda quiz: "Which session are you most excited for?" → Data for organizers

**ROI**:
- Event satisfaction: 18% increase (guests say "This felt unique!")
- Referrals: 32% more likely to recommend venue/planner
- Premium pricing: Event planners charge 10-15% more for "interactive experience package"

### Pain Point #5: Hard to Measure Event Success (Engagement Metrics)

**EngageOS Solution**:

**Real-Time Analytics Dashboard**:

**Engagement Metrics**:

- Photo booth usage rate

**Guest Behavior Insights**:
- Which trivia questions were easiest/hardest
- Social sharing rate (% of photo booth users who posted to Instagram)
- Email capture rate
- Geographic data (where guests traveled from - via opt-in pin map)

**Corporate Event ROI**:
- Lead capture: Emails, phone numbers, job titles
- Engagement scoring: Rank attendees by time spent at kiosk (hot leads)
- Content performance: Which branded games got most plays
- Social reach: Track hashtag mentions, calculate impressions

**Post-Event Report** (Delivered 48 hours after event):
```
Wedding Example:
- 140 guests, 98 interacted with kiosk (70% engagement)
- 112 photo booth uses (avg 3 photos per group)
- 84 emails captured (60% opt-in rate)
- 95 Instagram posts with #SmithWedding2025 (68% share rate)
- Total reach: 42,000 impressions across social media
- Top trivia question: "Where did they meet?" (87% got it right)

Value to venue: 42K impressions → estimated 21 venue inquiries from guests' friends
Value to planner: 84 emails added to marketing list → 4 estimated future bookings ($20K revenue)
```

### Case Study 3: MarketingCon 2025 (Conference - Hypothetical)

**Background**:
- 1,200 attendees
- 3-day conference (keynotes, breakout sessions, expo hall)
- Challenge: Low sponsor ROI, attendees don't visit booths

**Implementation**:
- Platinum Package: $2,500/day × 3 days = $7,500
- 3 kiosks (1 in lobby, 2 in expo hall)
- Custom games:
  - Exhibitor Scavenger Hunt (visit 10 sponsor booths to unlock clues)
  - Industry Trivia (marketing trends, sponsored by exhibitors)
  - Predict the Keynote (guess speaker's #1 takeaway)

**Results**:

**Engagement**:
- 840 of 1,200 attendees interacted (70% engagement rate)
- 680 played Exhibitor Scavenger Hunt → drove traffic to sponsor booths
- 520 played Industry Trivia (sponsors got brand exposure in quiz questions)
- 612 email captures (51% of attendees)

**Sponsor Value**:
- Scavenger Hunt: 680 attendees visited sponsor booths (vs 240 without kiosk - previous year data)
- Booth traffic increase: 183% YoY
- Sponsors willing to pay +$5K for "featured" status in kiosk games (new revenue stream)

**Conference Organizer ROI**:
- Kiosk cost: $7,500
- Sponsor upsell revenue: 8 sponsors × $5K = $40,000
- Net profit: $32,500
- ROI: 433%

**Testimonial**:
> *"The scavenger hunt was genius. Attendees actually visited booths instead of just grabbing swag and leaving. Sponsors loved it—we'll definitely do this again and charge more for kiosk game placements."*
> — **Mike Rodriguez, Event Director, MarketingCon**

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk #1: Guests Don't Use Kiosk (Low Engagement)

**Concern**: Kiosk sits unused, client unhappy

**Mitigation**:
- **Strategic placement**: Near bar, entrance (high-traffic areas)
- **Staff encouragement**: Train venue staff to point guests to kiosk
- **Prizes**: Offer raffle entry for playing trivia (prize provided by client or EngageOS)
- **Announcements**: DJ/emcee announces trivia leaderboard updates
- **Signage**: Eye-catching posters ("Play trivia! Win prizes!")

**Guarantee**: If engagement drops below 50%, refund 50% of rental fee

---

### Risk #2: Technical Failures (WiFi Down, Kiosk Crashes)

**Concern**: Kiosk malfunctions during event, no backup plan

**Mitigation**:
- **Offline mode**: Games work without internet (photo booth saves locally, uploads later)
- **Backup kiosk**: Always bring spare tablet (swap in 2 min if primary fails)
- **24/7 support**: Phone hotline for venues/clients (remote troubleshooting)
- **On-site tech** (Platinum package): Dedicated technician solves issues immediately

---

### Risk #3: Photo Booth Privacy Concerns

**Concern**: Guests uncomfortable with photos being shared publicly

**Mitigation**:
- **Opt-in sharing**: Guests choose to share (not automatic)
- **Private mode**: Photos saved to client's cloud only (no social posting)
- **Face blur option**: AI detects faces, blurs on request
- **Delete option**: Guests can delete photos within 24 hours (QR code on print)

---

### Risk #4: Event Planners Don't Adopt White-Label Model

**Concern**: Planners see kiosk as competition, not revenue opportunity

**Mitigation**:
- **Revenue share pitch**: Emphasize profit potential ($36K/year from 30 events)
- **Client retention data**: Show stats (20% more repeat bookings when clients love kiosk)
- **Exclusive territories**: Offer planner exclusive rights to their metro (no other planners get white-label)
- **Success stories**: Share case study of planner who added $50K annual revenue
