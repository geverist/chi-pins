## Quick Wins (Implement First)

### 1. üéÆ Interactive Demo Mode (NO LOGIN)
**Problem:** Users can't try before signing up
**Solution:** Let anyone play with a demo kiosk instantly

```javascript
// Add "Try Demo" button on login page
<button onClick={() => setMode('demo')}>
  üéØ Try Demo First (No Signup)
</button>

// Demo mode limitations:
- Pre-filled with sample data
- Can't save changes
- 15-minute session
- "Upgrade to save" prompts
```

**Impact:** Immediate value, reduces signup friction
**Time saved:** Users see value in 30 seconds vs 16+ minutes

---

### 2. üìã One-Click Industry Templates
**Problem:** Too many configuration options overwhelm new users
**Solution:** Pre-configured templates they can use immediately

```javascript
templates = {
  restaurant: {
    name: "Your Restaurant",
    games: ["trivia", "word-scramble"],
    colors: { primary: "#ef4444" },
    features: { games: true, feedback: true },
    sampleContent: {
      menuItems: ["Burger", "Fries", "Drink"],
      triviaQuestions: [/* 20 restaurant questions */]
    }
  }
}
```
