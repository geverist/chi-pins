2. Drag-and-drop or touch controls
3. Scoring system (accuracy + speed)
4. Persistent leaderboard with 3-letter initials
5. Extensible framework for adding more games

## Files Created

### Backend API Endpoint
- `/api/game-leaderboard.js` - Manages game scores (GET/POST)

### Database Schema
- `create-game-scores-table.sql` - Supabase table for storing leaderboards

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/GamesMenu.jsx` - Game selection menu
- `src/components/HotdogGame.jsx` - Chicago Dog Challenge game
- `src/components/GameLeaderboard.jsx` - Reusable leaderboard component

### UI Integration
- Added "🎮 Games" button to footer (leftmost position)
- Full-screen modal game interface

## Game: Chicago Dog Challenge 🌭

### Objective
Build a Chicago-style hot dog in the correct order as fast and accurately as possible.

### Controls
- **Desktop**: Drag ingredients from bottom to assembly area
- **Touch**: Tap ingredients to add them

### Scoring System

**Total Score = Accuracy Score + Speed Bonus**

- **Accuracy Score**: (Correct Items / Total Items) × 100 × 100
  - Each ingredient in correct position = points
  - Maximum: 10,000 points (100% accuracy)

- **Speed Bonus**: Up to 1,000 points
  - Fastest time (0s) = 1,000 bonus
  - 60 seconds = 0 bonus
  - Linear scale between

**Example Scores:**
- Perfect (100% accurate, 15s): ~10,750 points
- Good (89% accurate, 25s): ~9,483 points
- Okay (67% accurate, 45s): ~6,950 points

}
```

## Adding New Games

The system is designed to be extensible. To add a new game:

### 1. Create Game Component

```jsx
// src/components/MyNewGame.jsx
export default function MyNewGame({ onClose, onGameComplete }) {
  // Game logic here
  // Use GameLeaderboard component for scores
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

### 2. Add to Games Menu

```javascript
// src/components/GamesMenu.jsx
const GAMES = [
  {
    id: 'my-new-game',
    name: 'My New Game',
    description: 'Description here',
    emoji: '🎯',
    color: '#f59e0b',
    difficulty: 'Medium',
  },
  // ...
];
```

### 3. Wire Up Selection

```javascript
if (selectedGame === 'my-new-game') {
  return <MyNewGame onClose={() => setSelectedGame(null)} />;
}
```

### 4. Use Leaderboard

```jsx
<GameLeaderboard
  game="my-new-game"
  currentScore={score}
  currentAccuracy={accuracy}
  currentTime={time}
/>
```

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Create Database Table

```bash

```

### 2. Environment Variables

Already configured in existing Supabase setup:
