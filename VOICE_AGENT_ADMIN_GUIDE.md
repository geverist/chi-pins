## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Add multiple variations of the same question
   ```
   Q: "What time do you open?"
   Q: "When do you open today?"
   Q: "Are you open now?"
   ```

2. **Keep Answers Concise**: AI reads these aloud, keep under 30 seconds

3. **Update Regularly**: Add new entries based on call logs

4. **Use Categories**: Organize by topic for easier management

### Monitoring Tips

1. **Check Call Logs Daily**: Look for:
   - Unanswered questions
   - Common themes
   - Negative sentiment

2. **Review Voicemails**:
   - Follow up within 24 hours
   - Add missed info to knowledge base
   - Track recurring issues

3. **Test Regularly**:
   - Call your number weekly
   - Ask different types of questions
   - Verify greeting is appropriate
